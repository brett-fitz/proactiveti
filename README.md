*All things Proactive Threat Intelligence (PTI).*

## Overview

`proactiveti` - Python package and cli for proactive threat intelligence.

## :warning: Observables

It is important to note that leads generated from lead modules are **OBSERVABLES AND NOT INDICATORS**. Prior to classifying an
observable as an indicator, the observable should be verified as providers have a varying degree of latency. Furthermore, lead modules
provide leads that may require additional analysis to identify a given service.
